# An augmented reality business card

## Purpose
This project aims to be a fun, interactive way of viewing my portfolio, as well as getting in contact with me. I love being able to make new and exciting projects, and felt that this was a perfect opportunity as a beginner to learn how to use augmented reality technologies in a useful, practical way.

## Technologies
The business card utilises a QR code in order to link to the hosted project, as well as acting as a marker for the experience. To produce the actual AR elements, the A-Frame and AR.js libraries are utilised to create a 3D, interactive experience in most modern browsers, on most modern platforms.
